Tom Brady recently won his 6th Superbowl as the quarterback of the New England Patriots. Many have speculated that what makes Brady so good is his performance in the biggest situations, like the playoffs. We want to check if Brady actually throws for more yards in playoff games than he does in regular season games.

The 'brady.csv3' file contains data from all of Brady’s games and includes the following columns:

* game_type: Either “Regular” or “Playoff” indicating which type of game was played
* yards: Number of yards Tom Brady threw for in the game

Given this data, we have the following hypotheses:
* H0:μplayoff=μregular
* Ha:μplayoff>μregular

1. Find the difference in the average yards thrown for in playoff vs regular season games (5 points) 
2. Perform a permutation test with 10,000 samples and store the results in a vector (15 points) 
3. Calculate the p value for the observed difference in average yards thrown and its 95% confidence interval (10 points) 
4. Based on your results, does Tom Brady pass for more yards per game in the playoffs when compared to the regular season? (5 points)

Calculate the difference between average yards thrown for in regular vs. playoff games. The
'diff()' function, in this case, is calculating the difference between the two values
passed to it: the average yards thrown for in playoff and regular season games. To calculate
the difference it is subtracting the yards in playoff games from the yards in regular season. If our alternative hypothesis is correct, we expect a negative value for the 
difference.
```{r}
(actual_diff <- brady %>%
  group_by(game_type) %>%
  summarize(Avg_Yards = mean(yards)) %>%
  summarize(Diff_Avg_Yards = diff(Avg_Yards)))

actual_diff <- actual_diff %>%
  pull()
```
In our sample, Brady threw for 17 more yards per game in the playoffs, on average.

Since we are testing for a difference in average yards between playoff and regular season
games, we want to make sure the data falls under what we would expect when there is no 
difference in average yards. To do this, I randomize the 'yards' values within each
permutation sample, of which there are 10,000. Then, for each sample, I calculate the
difference in yards thrown between regular and playoff games.
```{r}
perm_diffs <- brady %>%
  rep_sample_n(size = nrow(brady), reps = 10000) %>%
  group_by(replicate) %>%
  mutate(perm_yards = sample(yards)) %>%
  group_by(replicate, game_type) %>%
  summarize(Avg_Yards = mean(perm_yards)) %>%
  summarize(Diff_Avg_Yards = diff(Avg_Yards))
```

Now I'll graph the null distribution with a verticle red line at the observed difference
in average yards to aid with intuition.
```{r}
perm_diffs %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Diff_Avg_Yards)) +
  geom_density() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = actual_diff, col = 'red') +
  labs(x = 'Difference',
       y = 'Density',
       title = 'Difference Between Regular and Playoff Game Yards')
```

Now I'll calculate the p-value for the observed difference in average yards thrown and a
95% confidence interval around that value.
```{r}
perm_diffs %>%
  summarize(P_Value = mean(Diff_Avg_Yards <= actual_diff),
            Lower_Bound = P_Value - qnorm(0.975) * sqrt(P_Value * (1 - P_Value) / n()),
            Upper_Bound = P_Value + qnorm(0.975) * sqrt(P_Value * (1 - P_Value) / n()))
```

Based on this permutation test, Brady does not pass for more yards on average during the 
playoffs than the regular season. The p-value associated with our observed difference
would need to be less than 0.025 since this is a two-sided test.
